# Python-Art
This program generates random shapes of random colours and sizes, unless you specify in the dictionary in main what colour, size, kind of shape, or number of shapes that you would like. The size of shape can be specified to be small or large. The colour of the shapes can be specified to be either Green, Blue, or Purple. The type of shape can be specified rectangle or circle. If you would like any of the fields to be random then you can simply put None in the dictionary.
